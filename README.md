## Description

Bookkeeper is a virtual library application for anyone wanting to store and keep track of their books in an organized fashion via the app's "shelves" feature. It also gives the user the ability to share their reading progress with other users that follow them. Reading books is a tremendous activity. Whether you're entertaining yourself, learning something new, or just decompressing after a long day, books are always there when you need them.

I wanted a virtual way to notate, share, and keep track of my books, so I built Bookkeeper. Originally, I put this application together in two weeks, mainly using React's Javascript library. My goals were to gain a better understanding of state and data relationships by incorporating full CRUD functionality, as well as becoming more familiar with the React library, specifically React Hooks and props, all while maintaining a user-friendly experience.

## Features
- Users can add or remove books to and from their personal library.
- Users can track their reading progress by organizing their books onto three different shelves.
- Users can take notes on any of the books in their library.
- Users can follow other users in order to share their reading progress with one another.
